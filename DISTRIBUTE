Some notes on building the modules / packages

The file MANIFEST.in contains the files that should be explicitly
INCLUDED or EXCLUDED from the distribution. Make sure to update:

setup.py with the version number
and
MANIFEST.in

as appropriate. Also, the tools for distribution:
%python setup.py sdist --formats=zip,gztar #creates .zip and .tar.gz 

%python setup.py bdist #creates binary distribution

You can also run:
%python setup.py sdist -formats=zip,gztar upload

and the created distributions will be uploaded directly to the PyPi.

LASTLY, if required, run:

%python setup.py register

if you have not yet done so.
